I'm **iVers**. *A low-skilled teen with big dreams.*  
I'm currently learning __C__!   
I'm experienced with the following languages: **python**, **javascript**, **batch** and more!

### ![SafeBrowsing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/585675227128659970.webp?size=32&quality=lossless) SafeBrowsing Extension
An undetectable Ad-Blocker and Tracker-Blocker. Sites can't detect it because its basically a proxy that blocks known tracking/ad providing sources without leaving a trace!

### EasyLang
It was supposed to be a language that would help beginers learn how to code. I realised that it was way beyond my skill level so now its sitting with two functions, Comments and Printing.
